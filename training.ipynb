    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning** is a machine learning approach where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The training data consists of input features (also called independent variables) and their corresponding known output labels (also called dependent variables or target variables). The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct output label for new, unseen input data. In other words, the algorithm learns from examples where the desired outcome is already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is a machine learning approach where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined output labels or target variables in unsupervised learning. The algorithm's objective is to find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without any prior knowledge of the outcomes. Unsupervised learning algorithms attempt to uncover hidden patterns, group similar data points together, or reduce the dimensionality of the data without being guided by explicit labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only used supervised learning, which is far more common. For the example above, many clustering algorithms exist which can group clusters together without using labelled data. "
